PowerSetCalculator Development Thoughts

My programming style has been moving toward a microObjects like practice.  Each class does one job and only one job.
Classes are small and immutable.  There are no getters or setters.  If-statements are only for guard clauses.

While I am still working on the practice, I have found that it has cause my programming to move a lot closer to true
OO design and makes the code more maintainable and simpler to write and understand.  It is still a practice for me.

As I start the project, my initial thought is to have a file-reader class, a calculator and the console class.
I'm sure that there will be a few more to come out of this direction, mostly helper classes.

The first focus will be on creating the Calculator class.  To write the first test, I wrote a ConsoleWrapper, that will 
wrap the Console object and allow me to write tests against the STDOUT output.
